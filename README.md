# Wine-Review-Classification

Introduction: 

For the final project, we chose to work with wine reviews classification tasks.  In this report, we will discuss the data acquiring and data wrangling process, then we will discuss the nature of the data. Lastly, we will report the accuracy of the classification models we ran. The goal of this project was to understand how to use descriptive data in wine reviews to predict the outcomes of the following three variables: price, points, and varieties.
